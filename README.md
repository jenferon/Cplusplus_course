A repository containing the weekly assignments and project work I did for my C++ course. This course aimed to introduce students to C++ and object-oriented programming. 

The syllabus was:
- Basic C++ features
- Data and file streams
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Advanced C++ features
- The C++ standard library

The project I chose was to make a data storage system for experimental physics data, which also had functionality to process the main results of the dataset.
